## .txt files

This program was tested with the 5 different matrices, which are included in this repository. 
In the line
```
file = open("mat5.txt")
```
simply replace mat5.txt with any of the given matrices you wish to test. Only input one matrix at a time. 



*Note: The orthogonality function may be buggy with certain matrices, will investigate later*
